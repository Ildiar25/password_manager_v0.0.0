# password_repository

That's the first view of my Password Manager program.

Here I'm going to include all versions I'll make and something I'll have learned on this journey.

Today I've learned about 'decode' and 'encode' methods.
By the time, I've had success when I tried to encrypt some information and I can say I'm happy about it.
I hope keep learning about this project!

with OS module, I've learned to create new directories and move different type of files.
Function 'open()' had helped me to create new files I'll need on future.
At least I could end my new function 'install'.
